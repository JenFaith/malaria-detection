# Malaria Detection
Using image recognition and convolutional neural networks to identify malaria infected cells

## General Info
For this project, I trained a Convolutional Nueral Network on 27,000 images of cells. The purpose was to decipher between infected and noninfected cells. The CNN returned a 91% accuracy on the validation set of images. That is, on images the model had never seen before, it correctly identified between healthy and infected cells 91% of the time. 

## Data
Data was pulled from kaggle dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
